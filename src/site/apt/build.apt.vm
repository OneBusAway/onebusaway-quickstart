onebusaway-quickstart

  We have a quick-start distribution designed to get you quickly up and running with OneBusAway.  This can be a good way to evaluate OneBusAway without getting bogged down in more complex deployment scenarios. 
  
  <<Current Version:>> ${currentVersion}
  
  This quick-start guide is targeted to OneBusAway version ${onebusaway_version}.  To get started, follow these instructions:
  
Quick-Start

#if( $currentVersion.contains('SNAPSHOT') )
  #set( $url = 'http://nexus.onebusaway.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=snapshots&g=org.onebusaway&a=onebusaway-quickstart-assembly&c=full&e=war&v=' + ${currentVersion} )
#else
  #set( $url = 'http://nexus.onebusaway.org/content/repositories/public/org/onebusaway/onebusaway-quickstart-assembly/' + ${currentVersion} + '/onebusaway-quickstart-assembly-' + ${currentVersion} + '.war' )
#end

  These instructions assume some comfort with the command-line in a Unix-like environment.  At a bare minimum, you'll need the {{{http://www.java.com/en/}Java}} installed on your system along with the OneBusAway quick-start distribution.

  You also need data.  At minimum, you'll need {{{http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html}GTFS}} static schedule data feed for your target transit agency.  Optionally, you can also supply {{{http://www.openstreetmap.org/}Open Street Map}} data for your area.  We will automatically download OSM for your area by default, but this can be a bit slow (in the <<<otp_graph>>> phase), so if you already have an OSM file for your region, things can go much faster.
  
  We'll use the OneBusAway quick-start app to build a transit data bundle: an optimized bundle of data built on top of the raw transit data designed to power the OneBusAway apps.  Once built, we spin up the most common webapps using the bundle.
  
  [[1]] Download {{{${url}}onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war}}
  
  [[1]] Make sure you have also downloaded the {{{http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html}GTFS}} for your transit agency
  
  [[1]] Run <<<java -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war -build path/to/gtfs.zip path/to/created-transit-bundle>>>
  
  [[1]] Run <<< java -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war -webapp path/to/created-transit-bundle>>>
  
  [[1]] Once the webapp has finished startup, browse to {{{http://localhost:8080/}http://localhost:8080/}}

  Depending on the size of your GTFS feed, you may need to specify a higher Java heap size (-Xmx500M or -Xmx1G).  If you optionally want to specify your own OSM data source, you can add the following command line option after <<<-build>>>:
  
  * <<<-osm path/to/data.osm path/to/gtfs.zip>>>
