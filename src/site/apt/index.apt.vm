onebusaway-quickstart

  We have a quick-start distribution designed to get you quickly up and running with the OneBusAway application suite.
This can be a good way to evaluate OneBusAway without getting bogged down in more complex deployment scenarios.

* What is OneBusAway?

  The OneBusAway application suite is a set of tools to help share real-time public transit information with riders
across a variety of interfaces.  It includes interfaces for the web, phone, sms, large sign displays, and a REST API
that powers a number of mobile applications.  For more information on these features, see the
{{{../../onebusaway-application-modules/${onebusaway_version}/index.html}application suite documentation}}.
  
Prerequisites

  At a bare minimum, you'll need {{{http://www.java.com/en/}Java}} installed on your system.  You will also need the
following:

* Transit Data

  You will need transit data to power your OneBusAway installation.  At minimum, you'll need
{{{http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html}GTFS}} static schedule data feed for your target
transit agency.  Optionally, but ideally, you will also need real-time data for your transit agency.  OneBusAway
supports real-time data for delays, service alerts, and vehicle positions in the
{{{http://code.google.com/transit/realtime/}GTFS-realtime}} format or the {{{http://siri.org.uk/}SIRI}} format.

* Download a Quickstart Bundle

#set( $webapp_url = 'http://nexus.onebusaway.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=public&g=org.onebusaway&a=onebusaway-quickstart-assembly&c=webapp&e=war&v=' + ${currentVersion} )
#set( $api_webapp_url = 'http://nexus.onebusaway.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=public&g=org.onebusaway&a=onebusaway-quickstart-assembly&c=api-webapp&e=war&v=' + ${currentVersion} )

  You need to download one of the quickstart bundles.  Pick a bundle based on what features you are interested in:  
  
    * The full webapp: {{{${webapp_url}}onebusaway-quickstart-assembly-webapp.war}} - Includes the {{{../../onebusaway-application-modules/${onebusaway_version}/api/where/index.html}REST API}} and {{{../../onebusaway-application-modules/${onebusaway_version}/features/web.html}the web interfaces}}
    
    * The API-only webapp: {{{${api_webapp_url}}onebusaway-quickstart-assembly-api-webapp.war}} - Includes just the {{{../../onebusaway-application-modules/${onebusaway_version}/api/where/index.html}REST API}}

Let's Go!

  Running OneBusAway is a two-step process:
  
  [[1]] Build a transit data bundle: raw transit data is processed into an optimized bundle, geared for fast access.
  
  [[2]] Run the OneBusAway webapp: actually start the OneBusAway web applications, using the transit data bundle.
  
  []
  
  You can perform these two steps either using our simple GUI configuration tool or from the command-line.
  
* Using the GUI

  We provide a simple wizard to help you configure and run the OneBusAway quick-start application.  Simply double-click
the downloaded quick-start war file.  Follow the steps and you'll be up and running in no time.

  <<NOTE:>> You may need to run the OneBusAway quick-start GUI from the command-line if you want to pass additional
options to <<<java>>>, like specifying more memory or server optimization:

+---+
java -Xmx1G -server -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war 
+---+

* Using the Command-Line

  First, build your transit data bundle:
     
+---+  
java -Xmx1G -server -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war -build path/to/gtfs.zip path/to/created-transit-bundle
+---+
  
  Next, run the webapp:

+---+  
java -Xmx1G -server -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war -webapp path/to/created-transit-bundle
+---+
  
  Once the webapp has finished startup, browse to {{{http://localhost:8080/}http://localhost:8080/}}
  
  To see more options for configuring the build and the webapp, including adding real-time information, specify the
<<<-help>>> option to get full usage instructions:

+---+  
java -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war -help
