onebusaway-quickstart

  We have a quick-start distribution designed to get you quickly up and running with OneBusAway.  This can be a good way to evaluate OneBusAway without getting bogged down in more complex deployment scenarios. 
  
  <<Current Version:>> ${currentVersion}
  
  This quick-start guide is targeted to OneBusAway version ${onebusaway_version}.  To get started, follow these instructions:
  
Quick-Start

#if( $currentVersion.contains('SNAPSHOT') )
  #set( $url = 'http://nexus.onebusaway.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=snapshots&g=org.onebusaway&a=onebusaway-quickstart-assembly&c=full&e=war&v=' + ${currentVersion} )
#else
  #set( $url = 'http://nexus.onebusaway.org/content/repositories/public/org/onebusaway/onebusaway-quickstart-assembly/' + ${currentVersion} + '/onebusaway-quickstart-assembly-' + ${currentVersion} + '.war' )
#end

  At a high level, you'll need the OneBusAway quick-start distribution and a {{{http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html}GTFS}} feed of transit data for your transit agency.  We'll use the OneBusAway quick-start app to build a transit data bundle: an optimized bundle of data built on top of the raw transit data designed to power the OneBusAway apps.  Once built, we spin up the most common webapps using the bundle.
  
  [[1]] Download {{{${url}}onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war}}
  
  [[1]] Make sure you have also downloaded the {{{http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html}GTFS}} for your transit agency
  
  [[1]] Run <<<java -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war -build path/to/your/gtfs.zip path/to/created-transit-bundle>>>
  
  [[1]] Run <<< java -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war -webapp path/to/created-transit-bundle>>>
  
  [[1]] Once the webapp has finished startup, browse to {{{http://localhost:8080/}http://localhost:8080/}}

  Depending on the size of your GTFS feed, you may need to specify a higher Java heap size (-Xmx500MB).
