onebusaway-quickstart

  We have a quick-start distribution designed to get you quickly up and running with the OneBusAway application suite.
This can be a good way to evaluate OneBusAway without getting bogged down in more complex deployment scenarios. 
  
  <<Quickstart Version:>> ${currentVersion}
  <<OneBusAway Version:>> {{{../../onebusaway-application-modules/${onebusaway_version}/index.html}${onebusaway_version}}}
  
* What is OneBusAway?

  The OneBusAway application suite is a set of tools to help share real-time public transit information with riders
across a variety of interfaces.  It includes interfaces for the web, phone, sms, large sign displays, and a REST API
that powers a number of mobile applications.  For more information on these features, see the
{{{../../onebusaway-application-modules/${onebusaway_version}/index.html}application suite documentation}}.
  
* Quick-Start

** Prerequisites

  At a bare minimum, you'll need {{{http://www.java.com/en/}Java}} installed on your system along.

** Transit Data

  You will need transit data to power your OneBusAway installation.  At minimum, you'll need
{{{http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html}GTFS}} static schedule data feed for your target
transit agency.  Optionally, but ideally, you will also need real-time data for your transit agency.  OneBusAway
supports real-time data for delays, service alerts, and vehicle positions in the
{{{http://code.google.com/transit/realtime/}GTFS-realtime}} format or the {{{http://siri.org.uk/}SIRI}} format.

** Download a Quickstart Bundle

#set( $webapp_url = 'http://nexus.onebusaway.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=snapshots&g=org.onebusaway&a=onebusaway-quickstart-assembly&c=webapp&e=war&v=' + ${currentVersion} )
#set( $api_webapp_url = 'http://nexus.onebusaway.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=snapshots&g=org.onebusaway&a=onebusaway-quickstart-assembly&c=api-webapp&e=war&v=' + ${currentVersion} )

  You need to download one of the quickstart bundles.  Pick a bundle based on what features you are interested in:  
  
    * The full webapp: {{{${webapp_url}}onebusaway-quickstart-assembly-webapp.war}} - Includes the {{{../../onebusaway-application-modules/${onebusaway_version}/api/where/index.html}REST API}} and {{{../../onebusaway-application-modules/${onebusaway_version}/features/web.html}the web interfaces}}
    
    * The API-only webapp: {{{${api_webapp_url}}onebusaway-quickstart-assembly-api-webapp.war}} - Includes just the {{{../../onebusaway-application-modules/${onebusaway_version}/api/where/index.html}REST API}}

** Build a Transit Data Bundle

  We'll use the OneBusAway quick-start app to build a transit data bundle: an optimized bundle of data built on top of the raw transit data designed to power the OneBusAway apps.  Once built, we spin up the most common webapps using the bundle.  
  
  Run <<<java -Xmx1G -server -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war -build path/to/gtfs.zip path/to/created-transit-bundle>>>
  
** Run the Webapp

  Run <<< java -Xmx1G -server -jar onebusaway-quickstart-assembly.war -webapp path/to/created-transit-bundle>>>
  
  Once the webapp has finished startup, browse to {{{http://localhost:8080/}http://localhost:8080/}}
