usage:
  -build [opts] gtfs.zip bundle        Build a transit data bundle, necessary to power the webapp      
  -webapp [opts] bundle                Start the webapp, powered by the transit data bundle
  
Running OneBusAway consists of two steps:

 1) Building a transit data bundle, combining raw transit data into optimized data structures for serving.
 2) Running the webapp, hosting the transit data stored in the bundle.

In the simplest case, you need a GTFS file, and a directory to store your transit data bundle:

 % java -Xmx1G -server -jar onebusaway-quickstart.war -build path/to/your/gtfs.zip path/to/your/bundle
 % java -Xmx1G -server -jar onebusaway-quickstart.war -webapp path/to/your/bundle

Each phase (-build, -webappp) has specific options as well.  You can see all the options with the following commands:

 % java -jar onebusaway-quickstart.war -build -help
 % java -jar onebusaway-quickstart.war -webapp -help
